**🏥 Hospital Management – SQL Data Analysis**

**📌 Project Overview**

This project analyzes a hospital management dataset to extract key insights about patient admissions, medical expenses, department performance, and hospital operations.
It demonstrates SQL skills in data exploration, aggregation, grouping, and reporting using PostgreSQL.

**📂 Dataset Structure**

Table: hospital_data

**Column Name**	                   **Description**
Hospital_Name  	               Name of the hospital
Location	                     City where hospital is located

Doctors_Count	                 Number of doctors available
Patients_Count	               Number of patients admitted
Admission_Date	               Date of patient admission
Discharge_Date	               Date of patient discharge
Medical_Expenses               Medical expenses incurred (₹)

**🔍 Key Analysis Queries**

- Total patients across all hospitals
- Average doctors count per hospital
- Top 3 departments with highest patient count
- Hospital with highest medical expenses
- Average medical expenses per day for each hospital
- Longest patient stay (difference between admission and discharge)
- Total patients per city
- Average stay duration by department
- Department with least patients
- Monthly medical expenses trend

**🛠 Technologies & Skills Used**

Database: PostgreSQL
SQL Concepts:
- SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT
- GROUP BY, Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
- DATE functions (DATE_TRUNC, date subtraction)
- Filtering and ranking results

**📜 How to Run This Project**

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/hospital-management-sql.git
2. Open Hospital Management_SQL_Data_Analysis.sql in your SQL editor.
3. Create the table and insert the dataset.
4. Run the analysis queries to explore insights.

**📈 Example Insights**

- Certain departments consistently handle higher patient volumes.
- Some hospitals incur significantly higher medical expenses than others.
- Monthly expense tracking reveals seasonal trends in admissions.
